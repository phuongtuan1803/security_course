title Sequence â€“ Spoofing PI to Inject Raw Flight Data

actor Attacker
participant "Network (LAN)" as Network
participant "Victim PI\n(dump1090)" as PI
participant "Victim Display\n(ADS-B Display)" as Display

== Step 1: MITM Setup via ARP Spoofing ==
' Attacker tricks the PI and Display to route packets through attacker
Attacker -> Network : Launch ARP spoofing\n (Bettercap/arpspoof)
Network -> PI : ARP reply:\n "Display is at Attacker IP"
Network -> Display : ARP reply:\n "PI is at Attacker IP"

== Step 2: Fake Data Injection ==
' Attacker now sits between Display and PI, or replaces PI entirely
Attacker -> Attacker : Generate fake packages\nMode-S packets (hex format)
Attacker -> Display : Send fake flight data \nto TCP port 30002

== Step 3: Display Behavior ==
' Display believes data is from PI
Display -> Display : Parse fake raw flight data
Display -> User : Show spoofed flight data
